![App Header](https://placehold.co/800x200/0d1117/c9d1d9?text=Bhrashtachar%20Mukt)

## Overview

**Bhrashtachar Mukt** is a comprehensive, AI-driven web application designed to create a transparent, accountable, and efficient ecosystem for reporting and combating corruption. This platform empowers citizens, assists law enforcement, and holds government bodies accountable through a suite of intelligent tools.

The core of this project is its **agentic AI**, which goes beyond simple data processing. Instead of acting as a passive tool, the AI functions as an autonomous agent that analyzes, assesses, and acts on information to streamline the entire anti-corruption lifecycle. It serves as a digital ally for citizens and a powerful assistant for authorities.

## The Problem

Corruption erodes public trust, hinders economic development, and denies citizens their right to fair public services. Traditional methods of reporting are often:
- **Intimidating:** Citizens fear reprisal for speaking out.
- **Opaque:** It's difficult to track the status of a complaint.
- **Inefficient:** Manual processing leads to long delays and bureaucratic hurdles.
- **Reactive:** Authorities often only act after significant damage has been done.

## Our Solution: An Agentic AI Approach

Bhrashtachar Mukt tackles these challenges by employing AI agents that automate and enhance key processes. This "agentic" nature means the AI takes initiative to achieve its goals—reducing corruption and increasing accountability.

Here’s how our AI agents work across the platform:

### 1. The Analyst Agent: Intelligent Complaint Processing
When a citizen files a complaint, the AI agent immediately:
- **Analyzes Complaint Text:** Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the context, severity, and entities involved in the complaint.
- **Auto-Generates FIR Drafts:** Creates a structured, preliminary First Information Report (FIR) draft, saving law enforcement critical time and reducing paperwork.
- **Categorizes & Triages:** Intelligently classifies the complaint (e.g., Bribery, Nepotism, Service Delay) and assesses its priority. This enables automated routing to the correct department or officer.

### 2. The Guardian Agent: Whistleblower Protection
To empower citizens to report without fear, this agent acts as a digital security advisor:
- **Assesses Risk:** Based on the complaint's nature and the user's desired anonymity level, the AI calculates the potential risk to the whistleblower.
- **Recommends Protective Measures:** Proactively provides a checklist of recommended actions to ensure the user's safety, such as secure communication practices and evidence handling.

### 3. The Legal Advisor Agent: Democratizing Legal Knowledge
Navigating the legal system is daunting. This agent provides instant, automated legal support:
- **Identifies Relevant Laws:** Maps the complaint type to specific legal sections and acts (e.g., Prevention of Corruption Act).
- **Provides Actionable Steps:** Outlines a clear, step-by-step guide for the user to follow, from evidence collection to follow-up procedures.
- **Estimates Timelines:** Gives an expected timeframe for case resolution based on historical data.

### 4. The Watchdog Agent: Driving Accountability
This agent ensures transparency and monitors performance:
- **Tracks Departmental Metrics:** Continuously analyzes data to generate performance scores for government departments based on resolution rates, average resolution time, and citizen satisfaction.
- **Detects Anomalies:** Proactively scans for unusual spikes in complaint volume or type in specific areas, flagging potential systemic issues or corruption hotspots for immediate attention.
- **Visualizes Data:** Powers the **Corruption Hotspots Map** and **Analytics Dashboard**, turning raw data into actionable insights for the public and for policymakers.

## Getting Started (Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bhrashtachar-mukt.git
cd bhrashtachar-mukt
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This needs to be done once for both the frontend and backend.

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && npm install && cd ..
```

### 3. Run the Application (One-Click Start)

Use the universal start script from the root directory.

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Make the script executable (only need to do this once)
chmod +x start.sh

# Run the script
./start.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
# Just run the batch file
start.bat
```

This will launch both the frontend and backend servers. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).
npm install

# Run the application
npm start
```

*(Backend setup instructions would follow here.)*
