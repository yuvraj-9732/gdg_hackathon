## Overview

**Bhrashtachar Mukt** is a comprehensive, AI-driven web application designed to create a transparent, accountable, and efficient ecosystem for reporting and combating corruption. This platform empowers citizens, assists law enforcement, and holds government bodies accountable through a suite of intelligent tools.

The core of this project is its **agentic AI**, which goes beyond simple data processing. Instead of acting as a passive tool, the AI functions as an autonomous agent that analyzes, assesses, and acts on information to streamline the entire anti-corruption lifecycle. It serves as a digital ally for citizens and a powerful assistant for authorities.

## Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)

What makes Bhrashtachar Mukt a game-changer?

-   **Agentic AI at its Core:** Unlike passive reporting portals, our platform uses Gemini as an autonomous agent that actively analyzes, drafts reports, identifies patterns, and suggests policy changes. It doesn't just store data; it acts on it.

-   **Complete End-to-End Ecosystem:** From a citizen's initial complaint to a high-level policy recommendation for government reform, the platform manages the entire anti-corruption lifecycle.

-   **Proactive & Preventative:** We go beyond punishing individuals. The "Systemic Flaw Analyst" is designed to identify and help fix the broken processes that enable corruption in the first place, preventing future incidents.

-   **Data-Driven, Unbiased Accountability:** The "Integrity Index" replaces subjective evaluations with hard data, creating a transparent and fair metric for departmental performance that is visible to the public.

## The Problem

Corruption erodes public trust, hinders economic development, and denies citizens their right to fair public services. Traditional methods of reporting are often:
- **Intimidating:** Citizens fear reprisal for speaking out.
- **Opaque:** It's difficult to track the status of a complaint.
- **Inefficient:** Manual processing leads to long delays and bureaucratic hurdles.
- **Reactive:** Authorities often only act after significant damage has been done.

## Our Solution: An Agentic AI Approach

Bhrashtachar Mukt tackles these challenges by employing AI agents, powered by **Google's Gemini Pro**, that automate and enhance key processes. This "agentic" nature means the AI takes initiative to achieve its goals—reducing corruption and increasing accountability.

Here’s how our AI agents work across the platform:

### 1. The Analyst Agent: Intelligent Complaint Processing
When a citizen files a complaint with supporting evidence (PDFs, images, videos), the **Gemini-powered Analyst Agent** immediately gets to work:
- **Redacts Personal Information (PII):** Before any analysis, the agent automatically scrubs the complaint description of sensitive data like names and phone numbers to ensure privacy.
- **Analyzes Complaint Text:** It uses advanced NLP to understand the core intent (e.g., bribery, harassment), assess the severity (low, medium, high), and determine the entities involved.
- **Auto-Generates FIR Drafts:** Using its analysis, the agent creates a structured, preliminary First Information Report (FIR) draft. This saves law enforcement critical time, reduces paperwork, and ensures key details are captured accurately from the start.
- **Suggests Actionable Steps:** The agent provides an initial recommendation for the next steps (e.g., "File FIR," "Initiate departmental complaint"), guiding the officer's response.

### 2. The Guardian Agent: Whistleblower Protection
To empower citizens to report without fear, this agent acts as a digital security advisor:
- **Assesses Risk:** Based on the complaint's nature and the user's desired anonymity level, the AI calculates the potential risk to the whistleblower.
- **Recommends Protective Measures:** Proactively provides a checklist of recommended actions to ensure the user's safety, such as secure communication practices and evidence handling.


### 3. The Legal Advisor Agent: Democratizing Legal Knowledge
Navigating the legal system is daunting. This agent provides instant, automated legal support:
- **Identifies Relevant Laws:** Maps the complaint type to specific legal sections and acts (e.g., Prevention of Corruption Act).
- **Provides Actionable Steps:** Outlines a clear, step-by-step guide for the user to follow, from evidence collection to follow-up procedures.
- **Estimates Timelines:** Gives an expected timeframe for case resolution based on historical data.

### 4. The Watchdog Agent: Quantifying Integrity
This agent ensures transparency and drives accountability by making performance measurable and public.
- **Calculates Integrity Index:** Continuously analyzes data to generate a dynamic "Integrity Index" score for government departments. This score is based on a weighted algorithm of:
    - **Complaint Resolution Rate:** How many cases are successfully closed?
    - **Citizen Satisfaction:** Post-resolution ratings (1-5 stars) provided by citizens.
- **Detects Anomalies:** Proactively scans for unusual spikes in complaint volume or type in specific areas, flagging potential corruption hotspots for immediate attention.
- **Visualizes Data:** Powers the **Corruption Hotspots Map** and **Analytics Dashboard**, turning raw data into actionable insights.

### 5. The Systemic Flaw Analyst Agent: From Case-Fixing to System-Fixing
This advanced agent, also powered by Gemini, moves beyond individual cases to identify and recommend fixes for the root causes of corruption.
- **Cluster Analysis:** It analyzes the entire dataset of complaints to find patterns—for example, dozens of "Service Delay" complaints at the same office, all mentioning a specific procedural step.
- **Generates Policy Memos:** When a pattern is detected, the agent autonomously generates a "Vulnerability Report" for policymakers, detailing the systemic flaw, the evidence, and a concrete policy recommendation to fix the underlying process.

### 6. The Internal Affairs Agent: Proactive Officer Tagging
This agent acts as an early-warning system for internal vigilance departments by "hot-tagging" officials based on specific and severe allegations.
- **Automatic Tagging:** When a complaint of a serious nature (e.g., "bribery") is filed and an officer is assigned or interacts with the case, the agent automatically tags that officer's internal record with the complaint type.
- **Pattern Identification:** The system tracks the number and type of tags for each official. An accumulation of tags (e.g., multiple bribery complaints) can automatically elevate an officer's status to "review required," flagging them for internal audit without manual intervention.
- **Unbiased Record Keeping:** This creates an immutable, data-driven record of allegations, ensuring that patterns of misconduct are identified and cannot be overlooked.

## Future Roadmap: The Next Frontier

The current platform is just the beginning. The following integrations are planned to amplify its impact:

1.  **Aadhar & UPI Integration:** For one-click, verified citizen identity confirmation and the secure, direct, and transparent distribution of whistleblower rewards into a user's bank account.

2.  **Police System Integration (e.g., CCTNS):** The platform will be able to directly file FIRs and push case updates into official police databases, eliminating redundant data entry and creating a seamless workflow for law enforcement.

3.  **Real-Time Officer Tracking:** For high-priority or time-sensitive complaints, citizens could receive real-time location updates of the dispatched officer on a map (similar to ride-sharing apps) to ensure a timely and verifiable response.

4.  **AI-Powered Criminal Triangulation:** By analyzing multiple community-sourced sightings of a wanted criminal, the AI will triangulate their probable current location and automatically generate real-time alerts for law enforcement agencies in that specific jurisdiction.

5.  **Emergency SOS Integration:** A one-touch SOS button within the app for citizens facing immediate threats (such as being asked for a bribe in real-time or facing harassment). This would instantly alert the nearest police control room with the user's live location, complaint context, and open a discreet audio recording channel.
